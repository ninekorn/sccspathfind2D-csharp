# sccspathfind 2D - my javascript ecmascript5 development to c# - works in Unity3D
This is my c# translation of my work i did on my mods for the game void expanse in javascript ecmascript5. I had worked a lot on pathfind from 2017-2019 and had taken as reference the Sebastian Lague pathfind tutorial on youtube. I first built my version in c# and it is very similar if not identical to the beginnings of the sebastian lagues pathfind tutorial and barely modified. But in void expanse i had to develop something different as initialising big pathfind grids were lagging VE and i had to script in javascript ecmascript 5 initially and it was weeks of work. I still don't even reunderstand fully my own development technique anymore in 2023. Hopefully it will come back to me. At least i was able to translate it so i am very happy here. This is approx a correct translation of my work on pathfind in javascript ecmascript 5 in my void expanse mods to c#. But somehow i had to work differently with the position of the objects compared to how i did it in my mods for void expanse.
