# sccspathfind
This is my c# translation of my work i did on my mods for the game void expanse. I had worked a lot on pathfind from 2017-2019 and had taken as reference the Sebastian Lague pathfind tutorial on youtube. I first built my version in c#, but in void expanse i had to develop something different as initialising big pathfind grids were lagging VE.
