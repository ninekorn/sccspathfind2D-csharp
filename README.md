# sccspathfind 2D - my javascript ecmascript5 development to c# - works in Unity3D
This is my c# translation of my work i did on my mods for the game void expanse in javascript ecmascript5. I had worked a lot on pathfind from 2017-2019 and had taken as reference the Sebastian Lague pathfind tutorial on youtube. I first built my version in c# and it is very similar if not identical to the beginnings of the sebastian lagues pathfind tutorial and barely modified. But in void expanse i had to develop something different as initialising big pathfind grids were lagging VE and i had to script in javascript ecmascript 5 initially and it was weeks of work. I still don't even reunderstand fully my own development technique anymore in 2023. Hopefully it will come back to me. At least i was able to translate it so i am very happy here. This is approx a correct translation of my work on pathfind in javascript ecmascript 5 in my void expanse mods to c#. But somehow i had to work differently with the position of the objects compared to how i did it in my mods for void expanse.

I have decided to release my c# pathfind development with the apache license 2.0, and decided to share my development to help with Cryofall mods. If i can successfully or not incorporate my c# pathfind development into Cryofall, which i should be able to if i start learning the cryofall c# API soon, doesn't matter anymore as i have finally released it and with the apache license 2.0 which is very permissive, others in the community might like my approach with pathfind although Sebastian Lagues pathfind and other libraries are also great. Basically as far as i understand, the Apache License 2.0 all sums up to referencing my name and work (including the work of others i reference in my own work) if you use my copies in other softwares you distribute or something close to that. I am unsure if this license choice was the right license to choose though, but i read on the internet it can protect a patent better, as i have not plagiarized my creation, and that it is compatible with the MIT license. I did use as reference the knowledge and a little bit of the code as reference from Sebastian Lague's pathfind tutorial on youtube (hosted on github.com MIT licensed), but not all of the code as linking grids together is something i developed on my own and fetching the index of grids in spiral is something i developed on my own and using premade arrays of unwalkable tiles and use the index is something i developed on my own, i didn't use as reference more than 1-2 episodes of Sebastian Lague's youtube pathfind tutorial which had helped me finally understand pathfinding in programming. Don't believe me? read my code, as this is a direct translation of my void expanse mod pathfind from javascript ecmascript5 to c# and i tried to be the most truthful i could be of my own development in my mods for void expanse for this c# translation. And i repeat, the architecture of how pathfind works, is very well explained in the first tutorial of pathfind of sebastian lague on youtube, and i use quite the hierarchy explained in the first video of the tutorial of sebastian lague. And unfortunately in the beginning my goal was to do a perfect translation of Sebastian Lagues pathfind tutorial on youtube to javascript ecmascript 5 strict mode, but i didn't have multithreading, i didn't have pathfind visible path, i didn't have anything. So i had to develop an alternative solution to reduce the weight of the pathfind for each script/drone that would use the script in my void expanse mods. Now, i have finally translated that work from javascript ecmascript5 to c#. Currently, i only made the pathfind work for the station exterior outpost, models that i had built for use in void expanse mods. I do not know how fast it fares against other pathfind techniques though. But currently my revision is not multithreaded and it is not using compute shaders for faster pathfind calculations. But no, i am not developing a void expanse game in unity. What i am doing was translating my pathfind from my void expanse mods in javascript ecmascript5, to c#, in order to use my pathfind for cryofall c# modding among using it with my own c# personal projects.

But please note that i have a lot of work left to do on adding every reference to others work including references from my own work that i move left and right everywhere in the projects that i make. I will try and work on that soon.

The debug.drawline is for the editor view, and this is a draft/wip project and it had to work, not be a game. It is to show the basics principles of my pathfind i had developed to use for void expanse mods.
